Cookies_________________________

A. Go to FDF and use your browser's Inspector to take a look at your cookies for cs338.jeffondich.com. Are there cookies for that domain? What are their names and values?
  There is a cookie in  cs338.jeffondich.com, it is a theme cookie, and the value is default.

B. Using the "Theme" menu on the FDF page, change your theme to red or blue. Look at your cookies for cs338.jeffondich.com again. Did they change?
  Yes changing the theme will change the value of the theme cookie to whatever theme I pick.



C. Do the previous two steps (examining cookies and changing the theme) using Burpsuite. What "Cookie:" and "Set-Cookie:" HTTP headers do you see? Do you see the same cookie values as you did with the Inspector?
  When I first load the website, the response to my GET request had a header of Set-Cookie: theme=default, which coorisponds with what we saw previously. It also shows an experiation date.
When chaning the theme, we see the GET request contain the requested theme as "?theme=red" and the cookie theme is still default. The response now contains a Set-Cookie header in which it matches the theme I picked out. 

D. Quit your browser, relaunch it, and go back to the FDF. Is your red or blue theme (wherever you last left it) still selected?
  Yes, after quitting and relaunching, the browser remained with the theme I kept, as the cookie the broswer sent the request with was teh theme I last selected.


E. How is the current theme transmitted between the browser and the FDF server?
  The current theme was sent via a header in the GET request, not a Set-Cookie but just a Cookie header with the value being red (the theme I picked).


F. When you change the theme, how is the change transmitted between the browser and the FDF server?
  When changing the theme, the server sends a GET request with the theme I requested as part of what it is getting. We see the GET requested formatted as:
  GET /fdf/?theme=blue HTTP/1.1
  The request then follows with a Set-Cookie header to contain the requested theme color.


G. How could you use your browser's Inspector to change the FDF theme without using the FDF's Theme menu?
     I cannot seem to do this, but I would think that changing the value of the cookie under the application/storage section of Inspect would be able to change the theme.




H. How could you use Burpsuite's Proxy tool to change the FDF theme without using the FDF's Theme menu?
  In Burp, we can edit the intercepted GET request to contain the desired theme, therefore changing the theme without us actually needing to click the theme button.


I. Where does your OS (the OS where you're running your browser and Burpsuite, that is) store cookies? (This will require some internet searching, most likely.)
  On Kali, Burpsuite stores the cookies in this sqp file at this path: /home/kali/.BurpSuite/pre-wired-browser/Default/Cookies



XSS__________________________

Provide a diagram and/or a step-by-step description of the nature and timing of Moriarty's attack on users of the FDF. Note that some of the relevant actions may happen long before other actions.



Describe an XSS attack that is more virulent than Moriarty's "turn something red" and "pop up a message" attacks. Think about what kinds of things the Javascript might have access to via Alice's browser when Alice views the attacker's post.




Do it again: describe a second attack that is more virulent than Moriarty's, but that's substantially different from your first idea.




What techniques can the server or the browser use to prevent what Moriarty is doing?
