A. Go to FDF and use your browser's Inspector to take a look at your cookies for cs338.jeffondich.com. Are there cookies for that domain? What are their names and values?




B. Using the "Theme" menu on the FDF page, change your theme to red or blue. Look at your cookies for cs338.jeffondich.com again. Did they change?




C. Do the previous two steps (examining cookies and changing the theme) using Burpsuite. What "Cookie:" and "Set-Cookie:" HTTP headers do you see? Do you see the same cookie values as you did with the Inspector?




D. Quit your browser, relaunch it, and go back to the FDF. Is your red or blue theme (wherever you last left it) still selected?




E. How is the current theme transmitted between the browser and the FDF server?





F. When you change the theme, how is the change transmitted between the browser and the FDF server?





G. How could you use your browser's Inspector to change the FDF theme without using the FDF's Theme menu?





H. How could you use Burpsuite's Proxy tool to change the FDF theme without using the FDF's Theme menu?





I. Where does your OS (the OS where you're running your browser and Burpsuite, that is) store cookies? (This will require some internet searching, most likely.)
