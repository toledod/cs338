        <h2>Fingerprint Enrollment: Capturing and Storing Fingerprints</h2>
        <br>
        <p class = "bodyText">The Enrollment Process: When a user sets up TouchID, they go through an “enrollment” process. This involves placing their finger on the sensor multiple times in different positions to capture the unique features of the fingerprint. This allows the sensor to create a detailed digital representation, capturing key fingerprint characteristics like ridge patterns and unique points called “minutiae” (Apple Inc., 2023). Each ridge and valley in a fingerprint forms a distinctive pattern, enabling the system to reliably distinguish one user's fingerprint from another's.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class = "bodyText">Capacitive Sensing Technology: TouchID uses capacitive sensing, a technology that captures an image of the fingerprint by measuring tiny differences in electrical conductivity. Real human skin, unlike fake materials, conducts electricity in a way that allows TouchID to capture unique patterns that are difficult to replicate (TechJournals, 2023). This enables the device to detect a real fingerprint rather than a replica, enhancing security by preventing fake fingerprints from bypassing authentication.

        <h2>Differences Across Apple Devices</h2>
        <br>
        <p class = "bodyText">iPhones and iPads: For iPhones and iPads, the TouchID sensor is typically integrated into the Home button or, in newer models, the power button. Each device has a Secure Enclave instance that holds the fingerprint data locally and prevents cross-device data sharing, so data remains secure and isolated on that particular device (Smith, 2023).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class = "bodyText"> MacBooks: On MacBooks, the TouchID sensor is embedded in the power button and is linked to the system’s keychain, which allows for a wider range of functions, such as authorizing app installations or making online payments. The Secure Enclave in Mac devices is customized to support these expanded capabilities while maintaining the same security standards as other Apple devices (Apple Inc., 2023).

        </p>
        <br>
        <p class = "bodyText"> By handling sensitive fingerprint data within the Secure Enclave and maintaining strict device-specific storage policies, Apple ensures that TouchID remains a reliable, privacy-focused authentication option across its product lineup </p>
