        <h2>What Is It</h2>
        <br>
        <p class = "introText">Biometric authentication represents a cybersecurity process, while the verification of identity is based on biological elements of the user, such as fingerprints, voices, retinas, or facial features. After that, the system will store this information in order to verify his or her identity whenever he or she wants to access his or her account. Such kind of verification normally is more secure than traditional forms of multi-factor verification.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class = "introText">In this instance, the biological trait used is detected by a fingerprint scanner that sits underneath the home button / TouchID button. According to Apple, "Every fingerprint is unique, so it's rare that even a small section of two separate fingerprints are alike enough to register as a match for Touch ID. The probability of this happening is 1 in 50,000 with a single, enrolled finger. And Touch ID allows only five unsuccessful fingerprint match attempts before you must enter your password."</p>
