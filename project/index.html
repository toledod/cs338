        <h2>What Is It</h2>
        <br>
        <p class = "introText">Biometric authentication refers to a cybersecurity process that verifies a user's identity using their unique biological traits such as fingerprints, voices, retinas, and facial features. Biometric authentication systems store this information in order to verify a user's identity when that user accesses their account. This type of authentication is usually more secure than traditional forms of multi-factor authentication.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class = "introText">In this case, the biological trait being used is a fingerprint that the scanner underneath the home button / TouchID button. According to Apple, “Every fingerprint is unique, so it's rare that even a small section of two separate fingerprints are alike enough to register as a match for Touch ID. The probability of this happening is 1 in 50,000 with a single, enrolled finger. And Touch ID allows only five unsuccessful fingerprint match attempts before you must enter your password.”</p>
