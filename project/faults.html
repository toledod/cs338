        <h2>Spoofing by Fake Fingerprints</h2>
        <br>
        <p class = "bodyText">One of the major vulnerabilities noticed is spoofing the TouchID with replica fingerprints. The researchers have shown that an artificial fingerprint can be produced that may, sometimes, get one through the TouchID sensor. This, though, can be rather cumbersome, requiring very good quality photographs of an individual's fingerprint, along with some special materials like silicone or latex (Smith, 2023). This vulnerability shows that, although successful spoofing is not easily achieved, TouchID is not resistant to a sophisticated attack."</p>

        <h2>Latent Fingerprints on Devices</h2>
        <br>
        <p class = "bodyText">
            Another concern is related to the latent fingerprints, which can be defined as residual prints left on the device screen or TouchID sensor. In a case where an attacker has access to these prints, he may try to recreate them using advanced techniques and thus unlock the device. Apple has tried to work around this with capacitive sensors, which rely on real skin that is alive; hence, using a latent print is hard. However, it remains theoretically possible in targeted applications involving a high level of risk.</p>
