===== DAYTIME =====
1. Identify the parts of the TCP 3-way handshake by listing the frame summaries of the relevant frames.

1  0.000000000  192.168.64.2  132.163.97.1  TCP  74  37218 → 13 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=32120 Len=® MSS=1460 SACK_PERM TSval=783313780 TSecr=0 WS=128
2  0.029730666  132.163.97.1  192.168.64.2  TCP  66  13 → 37218 [SYN, ACK] Seq=® Ack=1 Win=65535 Len=0 MSS=1382 WS=64 SACK_PERM
3  0.029981645  192.168.64.2  132.163.97.1  TCP  54  13 → 37218 [SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=65535 Len=0 37218 → 13 [ACK] Seq=1 Ack=1 Win=32128 Len=©|

2. What port number does the client (i.e. nc on your Kali computer) use for this interaction?

37218

3. Why does the client need a port?

The webserver needs a specific place to talk to me or else it might communicate with potential different servers on my computer. Hence 37218 is a port
that has been assigned the service to talk to this website. Also allows TCP to know what software it is talking to.

4. What frame contains the actual date and time? 

4  0.060677147  132.163.97.1  192.168.64.2  DAYTIME  105  DAYTIME Response

5. What do [SYN] and [ACK] mean?
[SYN] means that what was sent was a syncholization packet, making it possible to communicate with each other and help correct packet mistakes.
[ACK] send back the sequences number to ackwoloege that they recieved the message and are ready to talk to each other.

6. Which entity (the nc client or the daytime server) initiated the closing of the TCP connection? How can you tell?
The daytime server initiated the closing of the TCP connection as the first frame which contained a [FIN] had a source of 132.163.97.1
which is the daytime servers address.

===== HTTP =====
1. How many TCP connections were opened? How can you tell?

I will say 2 TCP connections where opened, as there was 4 FIN's sent within the wireshark capture, 2 from client/server for each connection.

2. Can you tell where my homepage (index.html) was requested? (If not, why not? If so, include frame summaries and/or other info that supports your answer.)

30  0.322491856  172.233.221.124 192.168.64.2  HTTP  667  HTTP/1.1 200 OK (text/html) - this frame holds the (text/html) which 
when we observe through wireshark, we can see that it hold the html of the index page.



3. Can you tell where my photograph (jeff-square-colorado.jpg) was requested?

32  0.377223341  192.168.64.2  172.233.221.124 HTTP  380  GET /jeff-square-colorado.jpg HTTP/1.1
This frame shows us a GET request from kali to the server, asking for the jeff-square png file.


===== QUESTIONS =====

This is helpful information to have, but I'm wondering how this could create vulnerabilities.
